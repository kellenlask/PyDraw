# PyDraw
Python drawing program to aggregate all the little drawing programs I like to make. 

Uses PyQt for projects targeting Python 3.4.2

## Issues
- Drawing blocks UI thread (very problematic for expensive drawing)
- Mandelbrot is currently broken (getting value for pixel always returns 0, was too lazy to look into it.)
